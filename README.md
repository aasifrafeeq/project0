Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


I have created a website about the movie Life of pie

I have a total of 5 html files with one css and one scss  file

all pages have a navigation bar on top

home.html : a huge poster image that resizes with small window and a simple login form from bootstrap
		(the login form don't actually do anything,just experimenting with bootstrap)

descrip.html : Two parts-overview and plot , provided two links for jumping to headings

image.html : poster images of the movie with grid from bootstrap

link.html : external links of different movies sites used a grid from bootstrap

table.html :a table showing budget earned by the movie each year
